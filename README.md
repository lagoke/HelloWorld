# Overview
This is a software project that initiates a software journey of developing various applications using several tools and programming languages.

In particular, this software displays " Hello, World!" and  "This is Olagoke Amiola" to the screen.

This software has been created to mark the beginning of my journey on the road to create my software portfolio.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
